shortDescription: "Learn how different sorting algorithms work and perform."
learningOutcome: "AlgoVisual was a great project for broadening my algorithm knowledge as I not only had to learn how different algorithms worked under the hood, but I also had to implement a visualization for them. Before AlgoVisual I had little experience with algorithms but after deploying it I felt a sense of fulfillment with the new knowledge and skills that I gained from the project."

With the visualizer feature users can play around with animating different sorting algorithms and changing the number of elements as well as the speed of the animation. There is an explanation section for six of the most popular algorithms and code snippets for them have been provided in six programming languages. A dark mode is available and the website has a mobile-first responsiveness.

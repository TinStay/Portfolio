shortDescription: "Choose the ingredients of your tasty burger and order it."
learningOutcome: "This is the first React application that I developed and it was the foundation of my frontend development path. I learned about what the difference between stateful and stateless components is and how state and props worked in a single-page application. I gained basic experience in installing and using node packages which has been vital for my subsequent projects."

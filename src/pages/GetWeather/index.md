shortDescription: "A weather app with a get-weather-at-location feature."
learningOutcome: "Building a simple weather application with an appealing layout was a good practice for fetching and working with data from an API. I realised that even a small app like this needs to be developed using a relevant design theme and colors in order to fit the idea behind it and catch the user's eye."

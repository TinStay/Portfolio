shortDescription: "Run and manage your social media advertising campaigns."
learningOutcome: "Building the ad campaign form has been a great exercise for handling state and errors. In order to build a better user interaction, I made use of many React libraries and APIs and integrating them into my application often lead to issues in my code. Dealing with those problems has brought to light many holes in my knowledge and also helped me to get a deeper understanding of the components I was building."

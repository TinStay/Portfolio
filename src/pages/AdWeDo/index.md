learningOutcome: "WeFontys was one of the first big group projects that I worked on in Fontys and it helped me understand more about group work and dynamics. Although I was the only person developing the application, planning and performing user testing on it was a collaborative work which gave me many new insights on how to communicate and present ideas to other people. WeFontys was not only a great way to improve my backend skills using Firebase services but it was also a great experience for designing a simple and intuitive UI.  "

shortDescription: "Why wait for slow delivery? Order something, grab it and go."
learningOutcome: "The project not only enhanced my existing front-end skills but it also expanded my scope of tools and libraries. Working with Next.js was a great base for comparion to React and implementing maps and pinpoints was a great learning challenge I tackled. Alongside all the tools I learned I believe the most valuable lesson I got from the project is to always focus on the important functionality first. There were many times I could have lost myself in the details but a user-friendly MVP was what I put all my efforts into - pick a store, add items to your shopping cart, order them, see when they will be ready for pick up and find the shortest route to the store."

Grab & Go is a personal project I built at the end of my first year in university. My goal behind it was to learn how to build an interface using Google Maps API. I always try to implement real-world ideas behind my projects so that they look complete and in this case the application was built around the idea of ordering goods and then picking them up from their store. This is my first project that I built using Next.js.

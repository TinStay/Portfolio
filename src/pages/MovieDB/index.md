A React app which lists movies in four different categories - popular, upcoming, top rated and now playing. Users can read overviews, find more information like movie's genres and avarage vote and subscribe to a monthly newsletter with email. The data about the movies is from the Movie Database API and I used axios for the requests. React Bootstrap and Bootstrap are the main libraries for the design and React Router was used for navigation throughout the site.

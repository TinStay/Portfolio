learningOutcome: "Developing Django websites like MyDiary is, in my opinion essential for learning how to manage the server-side a CRUD application. Creating data models and templates which are used to render the pages, as well as migrating and managing the database was very unclear for me at first, however, with time it all came together and I got hooked on building websites."

In this website the user can log in to create their personal diary. An entry has a title, a text and a date when it was posted. After creating one the user can then edit or remove it. The entries are sorted in the most recently created order and the user can use the search bar to filter them. The website has an authentication system which assures that the user will see only his diary. In the profile page one could change their username, email and their profile picture. This page has been added for future development of the website.

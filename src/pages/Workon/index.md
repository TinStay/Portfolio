shortDescription: "Manage your projects, tasks and working hours."
learningOutcome: "Designing the layout was really insightful because of all design choices I made in order to make it simple and appealing. This is the first project I built using TailwindCSS which I really enjoyed. Implementing a dark theme and dynamically displaying styling got me really deep into its fundamentals and documentation. The nature and simplicity of the project set the ground for another learning experience which is to build a REST API service using Golang."

Workon is a project I built to ease, simplify and automate daily work. I noticed that in order to record and manage my working hours I used three tools - a task app, a stopwatch and a notebook. The goal of Workon is to combine those tools into an appealing easy-to-use interface which would boost users productivity and give structure to their daily tasks. I have designed and implemented the UX by myself and I plan to build the back-end REST service using Golang.

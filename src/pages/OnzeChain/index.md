shortDescription: "Decentralized exchange for your crypto tokens."
learningOutcome: "The project was done during my second year of college and it was my first professional experience with blockchain technologies. As a team leader, I spent a great amount of time and effort establishing the working processes in our team. For example, I created a plan for when we would meet, how we would deliver and review work, and what tools we would use for managing the project. During daily meetings, I facilitated discussions by questioning the problems we were facing in search for the most effective solutions while listening to all viewpoints. In order to maintain high productivity, I kept motivation up by involving my team into different activities like new product features design and research. We achieved great results and I received great appreciation for my leadership."

OnzeChain is a Web3 project in which I was a team leader of a team of five talented developers. Initially, the product owner had planned to build a decentralized payment system, however, after careful consideration and planning, it was decided that a decentralized exchange would be the first step of the initial goal. In the Onzechain app, users can not only swap their tokens but they can also provide liquidity and earn passive income on their coins. The platform is developed on the Polygon network using smart contracts written in Solidity and a front-end written in React, Typescript.
